TDgame
======

NOTE:  Need to install PyGame module in order to run this:  www.pygame.org
       
       To play:
        - For /demo/ run open_me.py
        - For /game/ run player.py


This is a self-interest programming project.  I started with a pyGame tutorial here: 

http://karpathy.ca/phyces/tutorial1.php

From this I fleshed out the game into a demo, and then I will be working from that to turn the demo into a
tower defense game.


OUTLINE
=======

My goal is to make a build-your-own path style tower defense (TD) game, where you have a set of
workers which build and maintain a base in order to mitigate an influx of creeps.

Features that I hope to eventually include are:

  - Multiple types of resources for various activities
  - Workers need to carry resources such as money and metal to a tower build site in order
    to build/upgrade/repair it.
  - Use money for buy more workers, upgrade things, etc etc...
  - Connect towers to power plant
  - Build walls to control flow of creeps conveniently around towers
  - Player will need to actively use workers to replentish ammunition in towers
  
  - A nice gui with build progress bars and stuff

My idea is for a more involved TD game similar to the old Warcraft 3 TD mods.  Since this is also meant as
practice for me, I would like to explore things such as creep AI pathing, sprite rendering, and just
programming in general. :)
